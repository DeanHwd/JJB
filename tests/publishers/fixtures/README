This directory contains fixtures to test the publishers.

The filename should start with a publisher name (example: xunit) and you must
provide two files:
 - .yaml : yaml snippet representing the publisher as it would be written
           in jenkins job builder configuration file.
 - .xml  : xml Jenkins snippet that should be rendered by the publisher

Each yaml file MUST have a corresponding xml file.

Once the YAML file has been parsed, it is prettify using python minidom
which also means that:
- your XML file must start with: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
- self closing elements do not contains space eg: <element/>
